Life goes on and a new Christmas comes

Life goes on and a new Christmas comes
and we go under the sun, the earth turns
continually, ... praying for his holy birth
forget our own, mother, such rotten girth.
In the eyes of the noblest ones of them all
we wonder,...
will he die for my sins, or his own fall?

The life of a child, the son of holy union
( how about you )
the largest symbol, to many heathens, opinion
( surely you believe )
yet, as we remenber this day of his coming
( as you and I )
many more will surely be coming, atoning
( right )
many silly notions of our lowly, sad, life
when it matters not his real truth or spite
for your day for the deliverance of your heart
will stand one day, look around, also smart
( for real this time )
and wish for things already gone very far
hoping for a new start, everglowing star
of hopes, wishes, dreams, visions and faiths
that have never wanted you around
except when you can justify your being
through a gross process of your mind
where the cynic eyes choose your law
as simple, and above that of the flaw
which we have created for ourselves.

Awake!!! All you noble souls, realize, celebrate
the very birth of your own heart, you ingrate,
into my arms, the ones you have e'er hoped
while you prayed, you cried, learnd, invoked
for a freedom on this earth
( your own )
with its carefully crafted dearth
( nature )
where so many can be created
devoid of heart and nurture
ready to fight another war
and die in splendour,
once again,
...
let them be born,
again,
those with the courage,
but never shall you try
to tell them why,
and how,
you just don't know,
you really don't know,
and why should you know...
