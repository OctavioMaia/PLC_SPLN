After writing letters all day...

After writing letters all day, I wrote a song for...
(lisa)
the vision, that for me, I really must long for...
(oh yes, how I miss you)
then I cry...
lonely...
bare heart...
body and feet...

After a while, I was glad that it wasn't called for
any reason, beyond the rhyme you wanted, a metaphor
(oh lisa, oh lisa)
and I stopped the few tears
by wishing,
blessing,
my lonely bare heart,
while thinking of yours...

All because of you, since I thought and wished for
that holy dream, apeared in my sights, wherefor;
hope has turned into vision
which I have wanted for so very long
they say,
I'm being taught patience
ok, ok, ok,
that love needs to be ever so strong
why, why, 
and thru you and I, lenience.

And as I tired of words, or passions for
delirious desires, visions I have faith for
another day,
...
other thoughts,
will be born...
twins,
you'll be torn...
arising above the form
whre vision is forlorn
...
your kiss shall be full of life
...
and you'll be forgiven
...
you have no sins
...
and I bless you being here,
in spirit,
as a sacramentel act of your nature,
for which, I consider myself lucky
...
we have met.

.....I can't hope for you any more
it tears me apart to the last pore
o' my heart...
Still I sit here loving you
wishing the best light thru
to guide me in my vision,
round this heaven, the earth
where I wouldn't think of living
next to this strange, blessed,
god-forsaken dirt
...
without being able
...
to write, yet another song.

After writing letters all day, I wrote a song for...
(lisa)...
