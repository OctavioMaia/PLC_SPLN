I wanted to write a line of poetry

I wanted to write a line of poetry
when words failed me, I know not
how to find rhymes of symmetry.
All of a sudden. Done. A final dot.

You say quarks, strangeness and charm,
I say talk, talk, never say anything,
for the line flows, a stream, no harm.
To my mind and body, just a fling.

I wanted to write a line that rhymes
and all I find is that old feeling
short of acting, mirror of the mimes
with attributes always too fleeting.

You say this is good, this is bad,
I say, I know not how the line came
yet, the next word in the order ahead
will still appear, sharply, but tame.

I wanted to write a line for an ode
and my sadness, then, started to grow,
oh thankfull spirit, theach me the mode
and I will help you shine and glow.

I wanted to write a line of poetry,
only to find there existed symmetry.
I then stopped writing, 
I wanted the lines to stir and move 
until there was no life to prove..
except,...
that,...
they had a life of their own,...
